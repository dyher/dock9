Sapidlib will currently run on two lpmud drivers: FluffOS and MudOS.

If you think FluffOS and MudOS sound similiar, you're absolutely correct -
they both end in OS. Besides that, FluffOS is a fork of the MudOS driver
which means that in simple terms: FluffOS is MudOS with extra. This is
especially true because MudOS hasn't been updated in ages whereas FluffOS
still gets the odd update. 

Which driver should you use? You'll probably want to use FluffOS but you'll
find that older code may not work under FluffOS anymore because FluffOS has
stricter type checking.

You can find the appropriate local_options file in etc/local_options.DRIVER
(replacing DRIVER with the driver you are compiling, ie. fluffos or mudos).

You may notice a third directory named 'rth'. This is a variant of the FluffOS
driver maintained by Sapidlib developer Richard Thomas Harrison aka Tricky.
There isn't a whole lot of difference between the 2 FluffOS's except for some
minor fixes and more compatibility with Cygwin. To use this driver just enter
the 'rth' directory and type './configure sapid' and follow the instructions.
