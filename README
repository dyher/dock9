Welcome to Dock 9 -- http://github.com/emsenn/Dock-9/

Dock 9 is a MUD (multiple-user dimension) that focuses on being very
detailed, making a game world that is not only high quality but fun
to explore.  Founded in October, 2009, and built on FluffOS (RocktheHalo
variant) and the Sapidlib mudbase by emsenn (Morgan Sennhauser) and abzde 
(Hunter Carroll), Dock 9 attempts to take advantage of being text only, 
to create a game environment that would be nearly impossible with graphics.
