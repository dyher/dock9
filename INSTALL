Setting up your very own Sapidlib is simple and a fun experience for the whole family.

1) cd ./driver/rth/
2) ./configure sapid
3) make
4) make install
5) cd ../../etc/
6) cp config.lpu config.mud
7) edit config.mud to your desired settings.
8) ./startmud &

If for whatever reason your character is not made an admin when you login, log out and do the following from the root directory (for example, /home/user/sapidlib):

1) rm -r ./lib/data/users/<first initial of character name>/<character name>  (For example, I'd do rm -r ./lib/data/users/e/emsenn/)
2) touch ./lib/adm/etc/new_install
3) log back in.
